My production function is a class Records that uses a for loop to check through instances of the 
Record class and decide how much or not at all to tax these records and then returns a final price 
for the whole list of records. I did my tests using pytest, and raised errors
in the code where appropriate. I tested for negative prices, invalid states, invalid categories or 
data types, each states tax, ma clothing tax, and making the function not case sensitive. 
I used assertions for happy path and raised errors otherwise.
